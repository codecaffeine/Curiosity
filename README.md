# Curiosity
## Advanced[^fn-sample_footnote] Regular Expression Editor for iOS

Curiosity is an advanced regular expression editor for iOS. Import any text file into Curiosity and create complex pattern matches to analyze and process the data.

Import from:
- URL
- GitHub
- DropBox

So, I have importing from URL kinda working. What should I focus on now?
1. Find URLS

[^fn-sample_footnote]: What makes it advanced? A visual regular expression creator? No regex gobeldy-gook?
